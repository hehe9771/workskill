## Key Features

- Adds `speckit.preview` as the single preview command.
- Requires `low`, `mid`, or `high` as the first command argument.
- Generates one HTML design artifact at `specs/<feature>/preview/wireflow.html`.
- Requires `spec.md` and `uc.md` as first-class source inputs for design synthesis.
- Runs an Input-to-Design Synthesis Pass before composing the design artifact.
- Preserves `schemas/preview/mid-ir-adapter.schema.json` as an optional supporting input boundary for `mid` fidelity.
- Uses evidence and quality conclusions to improve the fidelity-specific design artifact by exposing supported flows, gaps, and design questions.
- Uses fixed `templates/preview/wireflow.html` output structure with design input mapping, interaction, state, and preserved design-note slots.
- Uses `schemas/preview/contract.json` and `schemas/preview/contract.schema.json` as the structural validation source.
- Keeps the preview self-contained with inline CSS and template-local JavaScript.
- Explicitly avoids production source, spec, plan, and task file changes.

## Testing Performed

- `python -m py_compile tests/validate-extension.py`
- `python tests/validate-extension.py`
- Validator verified the manifest registers one `speckit.preview` command.
- Validator verified the command/template file set contains only `commands/speckit.preview.md` and `templates/preview/wireflow.html`.
- Validator verified declared schema files, including `schemas/preview/mid-ir-adapter.schema.json`.
- Validator verified documentation alignment for `speckit.preview` and `wireflow.html`.
